       "'New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner took four wickets as they beat Bangladesh by 17 runs in a rain-affected third and final Twenty20 international on Sunday to draw the series 1-1. After dismissing the tourists for 110 in Mount Maunganui, New Zealand\\'s top-order collapsed to 49-5 before Jimmy Neesham and Santner recovered to reach 95-5 off 14.4 overs. When heavy rain halted play, the Black Caps were comfortably ahead of the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern target, thanks largely to an unbeaten 28 from all-rounder Neesham. The result denied Bangladesh a first series victory on New Zealand soil in any format, having lost the preceding ODI series 2-1. \"Our bowlers did the job up front keeping them to 110 and it\\'s good to get across the line in what\\'s been a pretty tough-fought series,\" Santner said. \"It got quite tight in the end today. Credit to Bangladesh, their bowlers have bowled extremely well. They put us under some real pressure again.\" After asking Bangladesh to bat first on a lively Bay Oval pitch, Santner claimed 4-16 off his four overs, stifling an innings that was already struggling at 41-3 when he was introduced. Seamers Tim Southee , Adam Milne and Ben Sears all took two wickets. Milne (2-23) removed Bangladesh captain and top-scorer Najmul Hossain Shanto for 17 when he skied a full-pitched delivery to point. Shanto rued the fact that he and four other Bangladesh batsmen reached double figures, but all failed to convert into a substantial score. \"The bowlers did a great job but the batsmen didn\\'t get runs today,\" he said. Advertisement \"In T20s the top of the order is very important. Our batsmen got starts, like 15 or 17, but they\\'re not taking the game deep.\" Four of New Zealand\\'s top order were dismissed for one run and when Finn Allen followed after scoring 38, Neesham held the innings together as the storm clouds gathered, with solid support from Santner who was unbeaten on 18. Seam bowler Shoriful Islam took 2-17 off 3.4 overs. Bangladesh won the first game in Napier on Wednesday by five wickets, before Friday\\'s second match was abandoned after 11 overs because of rain in Mount Maunganui.

    "qfef = 'LONDON (AP) — Eurostar services to and from London were canceled Saturday after a tunnel under the River Thames became flooded, disrupting festive travel plans. Hundreds of travelers trying to get across the English Channel were stranded at London’s St. Pancras International station and the Gare du Nord station in Paris. Eurostar, which runs services from London to Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, said it canceled at least 29 trains Saturday and is not expected to run any services for the rest of the day because of the flooding. Engineers working on the tunnel said water levels were reducing. The volume of water in the tunnel was “unprecedented,\" they said. The U.K. has been battered by strong, gusty winds and heavy rain brought by Storm Gerrit throughout the festive period. More stormy weather and travel disruption is expected during the last weekend of the year. Chris Dillashaw, from San Antonio, Texas, was among many whose plans for New Year’s Eve were ruined by the travel chaos. “Our entire family is here. ... We were celebrating Christmas in Paris and then headed to London for our New Year’s Eve plans,” he told The Associated Press while waiting at Gare du Nord. “It’s pretty disappointing to find out via an email what happened.” Christina David, 25, and Georgina Benyamin, 26, from Sydney, said they have nowhere to stay after finding out that their train from London to Paris — their final stop in a weeks-long European tour — was canceled. “We paid for an expensive hotel with an Eiffel Tower view,” Benyamin said. “Now we have to book a hotel to stay for the night here. We don’t know where to go; we have nowhere to stay.” Eurostar said it was “extremely sorry for the unforeseen issues affecting our customers and services.” “We understand this is a vital time to get home at the end of the festive season and ahead of New Year,\" the company said. Eurostar services were also disrupted just before Christmas due to a strike by staff at Eurotunnel. The U.K.’s weather forecaster, the Met Office, said more high winds and rain are expected to hit London and southern England on Saturday. Gusts of up to 50 miles per hour (80 kph) are expected, with the strongest winds likely near coastal areas. Sylvia Hui, The Associated Press'\n",

      "Australians turned out in their hundreds of thousands to see in the new year under a midnight sky lit up by fireworks – the harbour bridge an iconic backdrop for many.\n",
      "In Sydney, crowds were abuzz and at maximum capacity as revellers crammed picnic rugs together across harbour foreshore vantage points.\n",
      "More than 8.5 tonnes of fireworks went up in smoke alongside 80,000 pyrotechnic effects and the sounds of jubilant cheers.\n",
      "For some, it was a 17-hour wait after queuing from the early hours of the morning to snag a premium spot.\n",
      "But it was worth it as the clock struck 12 for the families, friends, world travellers and locals alike who enjoyed the front-row display of pyrotechnics, a smoking ceremony, AI-driven projections onto the harbour bridge and illuminated boats on the water.\n",
      "Smaller groups were seen dancing on the pylons of the Harbour Bridge while children looked on in wonder.\n",
      "By 5pm most major vantage points around the foreshore had already reached capacity with the Sydney Opera House full by 11.30am.\n",
      "Janna Thomas, visiting from Germany, is spending her first New Year’s Eve in Sydney and grabbed a spot in the Botanic Gardens.\n",
      "“It’s unbelievable we are here.\n",
      "It feels surreal,” she said.\n",
      "Having waited in line since 7.30am, she described the scene as “total madness”.\n",
      "“It’s not so easy to find a good place to sit but the view is incredible.” Sydney Mayor Clover Moore said the city’s New Year’s Eve festivities provided a $280 million boost to the economy, according to a 2019 study.\n",
      "“They remind the world that Sydney is a global city for tourism, for business, for culture, for technological creativity and most important, Sydney is an inclusive and diverse city for all our communities,” she told reporters on Sunday.\n",
      "Melbourne was treated to a non-stop and vibrant fireworks display alongside a far-reaching laser show that ignited the city’s skyline from across 27 rooftops.\n",
      "Cheers reverberated through the city after the 12pm show, with hoards of people shuffling out of designated celebration zones after witnessing the three semi-trailer loads of pyrotechnics.\n",
      "Crowds of more than 400,000 gathered in the city centre to ring in the new year, many vying for a spot at the Docklands’ waterfront.\n",
      "Rose Stafrace, from Mill Park in Melbourne’s northeast, had ventured into the city for the fireworks for more than three decades.She thought 2023’s New Year’s Eve crowd was bigger than the last.\n",
      "“Every year it gets more and more people,” Ms Stafrace told AAP.\n",
      "Outside Flinders Street Station was choked with people as security officers diverted pedestrian traffic and hoards of revellers flanked either side of the Yarra River.\n",
      "Melbourne local Jude Esom, who was joined by his partner Tatyanna Herrick and their fourth-month-old son Chiemek Chiazor, was lured to Kings Domain with the promise of Afrobeats.\n",
      "“I’m from Nigeria, so that’s from my country,” he told AAP.\n",
      "“I love it when I come here and see different people, different nationalities.\n",
      "“It gives me the joy of the Melbourne community.” Similar scenes were happening or about to happen in other state capitals.\n",
      "Thunderstorms brought torrential rain to the storm-battered Gold Coast during the night but didn’t stop an early fireworks display at Surfer’s Paradise before that area was hit by a deluge..\n",
