      " (UPDATE) A large part of Tandag City in Surigao del Sur was submerged in floods this Sunday due to the non-stop rain brought by Typhoon Auring.  The provincial government of Surigao del Sur released aerial footage showing many areas in the city submerged in floods.  According to Governor Alexander Pimentel, the evacuation of residents and vigilance in communities that may be affected by severe flooding are ongoing.  \"We are monitoring something now, because it is the internal barangays that are being flooded,\" said Pimentel.  Food has also been given to those in the evacuation center.  A resident also captured a video of the flood sweeping away a house in Dawis, Tandag City.  In the town of Marihatag, it was difficult for the soldiers' vehicles to pass through the roads due to the flood.  The soldiers were supposed to assist in rescue operations in other parts of the province.  In Lanuza, the Department of Public Works and Highways conducted a clearing operation on the road to Tandag City due to the landslide.  In Madrid, the water in the Carac-an River and Piagawan River almost overflowed the road.  There are also some barangay roads that are impassable due to overflowing floods, and there are some residents who still do not want to evacuate.  The flood also overflowed the road in Barangay Cuyago in the town of Jabonga, Agusan del Norte this Sunday morning.  There was also a landslide near Barangay Baleguian.  In Misamis Oriental, Julius Bajao, 40 years old, was swept away by strong currents when he forced himself to cross a creek in the town of Medina on Friday night.  Even though there were big waves because of Typhoon Auring, the maritime police still conducted the search and rescue operation.  This Saturday, the local government of Tomas Oppus, Southern Leyte has also conducted a pre-emptive evacuation.  As many as 9 families from Barangay Biasong were evacuated because the said area is prone to landslides.  The families will stay at the evacuation center until Typhoon Auring makes landfall.  The barge trip to Camiguin Island from Misamis Oriental is suspended due to the typhoon.  Passengers of cargo trucks stranded at Balingoan Port in Misamis Oriental.\n"
